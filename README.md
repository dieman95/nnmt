# NeuralNetworkToolParsers

This repository contains parsers for creating input files in the format ofthe various neural network verification tools available in the research community. It also contains scripts for translating neural network models into .mat files that store  the network weight matrices and biases for each layer sequentially.

## Parsers available for neural networks created in the following libraries:
- Tensorflow 
- Keras
- PyTorch (currently working on supporting models for this tool)

## Verification Tools Currently Supported
- Reluplex
- Sherlock
